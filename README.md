## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a driving school to handle student registrations, scheduling driving lessons, tracking progress, and managing instructor feedback. The goal was to create something easy to use for students, instructors, and administrators while meeting all the client’s needs. It also needed to integrate with existing tools and provide a smooth user experience.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a great job with the UML diagrams. They were clear and detailed, making it easy to understand how everything in the system works together. The activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams helped show the flow of actions and how users interact with the system. I also made sure the design was user friendly and focused on the features the client needed the most.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to go back and revise something, it would probably be the class diagram. While it covered the main components, I think I could refine the relationships between entities a bit more. Adding more specific attributes and methods could make it even more detailed and useful for implementation later on.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To figure out the user’s needs, I spent a lot of time going over the business requirements document. For example, I made the registration process simple and secure because I knew students needed something straightforward to get started. Thinking about how the users would actually interact with the system really helped me focus on what was most important for the design.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I like to break everything into smaller pieces and focus on what the users need. For this project, I used UML diagrams to map out the system and make sure all the parts worked well together. In the future, I’d keep using tools like UML diagrams and also get feedback from users throughout the process to make sure the design is on the right track.
